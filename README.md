Healthcare Data Analysis Report
Objective: This report summarizes key insights from the healthcare data analysis project, focusing on billing amounts, patient demographics, admission types, and medical conditions.
Key Findings
1.	Billing Analysis:
•	Average Billing Amount: The average billing amount across all patients is calculated to provide insights into healthcare costs.
•	Total Healthcare Cost: The total billing amount indicates the overall financial burden on the healthcare system.
•	Billing Variation by Insurance Provider: Different insurance providers show significant variations in average billing amounts, highlighting disparities in coverage and costs.
2.	Patient Demographics:
•	Total Number of Patients: The dataset reveals the total number of distinct patients treated.
•	Gender Distribution: Analyzing patient counts by gender helps understand demographic trends within the healthcare system.
•	Age Distribution: Patients are categorized into age ranges to identify age-related health trends and service needs.
3.	Admission Types:
•	Total Admissions Count: The total number of admissions provides insight into healthcare demand.
•	Admissions by Type: Breakdown of admissions into categories such as 'Urgent', 'Emergency', and 'Elective' helps assess service utilization patterns.
4.	Medical Conditions:
•	Billing Amounts by Medical Condition: Average billing amounts are analyzed for various medical conditions, revealing which conditions incur higher costs.
•	Top Medical Conditions with Highest Average Billing: Identifying the most costly medical conditions can inform resource allocation and policy decisions.
5.	Readmission Rates:
•	Calculating readmission rates provides insights into patient outcomes and the effectiveness of care provided.
6.	Hospital Performance:
